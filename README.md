## Project
Building a simple CRUD app (To do list) using Flask framework. \
\
In this project I focus more on the backend then the Frontend, it was really fun to learn python and flask framework :smile:. \
**[Demo app](https://todolist-app2022.herokuapp.com/) deployed on Heroku**
## Setup (Mac/Linux)
- Create a `virtual environement` folder (venv) inside the project folder:

```
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
python3 -m venv venv
```
- Activate the environement:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
- I created a `requirements.txt` file to make it easy for you to install the necessary packages automatically for this project:
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
- As you will see in my project folder that I already initialize the database, but If you want to know how, follow this link [SQLAlchemy Quickstart](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/quickstart/#installation).
- Run the app and enjoy it :smile::
```
flask run
```

**Note:** If you want to know why we created a virual environement and the installation process for Windows visit this link [Flask Installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/), also make sure you have the `virtualenv` package installed by using `sudo pip3 install virtualenv` in order to create a virtual environement.
